# DevOps for data scientists

This repository contains a small introduction to *developer operations* (DevOps) for students in the course
[Grundl√¶ggende Data Science (GDS)](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndab23000u/2024-2025) at Copenhagen University.
The four core topics covered are:
1. [Virtual environments](https://github.com/elliottd/ku_gds_devops/tree/main/virtual_environments)
2. [Version control](https://github.com/elliottd/ku_gds_devops/tree/main/version_control)
3. [Code testing](https://github.com/elliottd/ku_gds_devops/tree/main/code_testing)
4. [Experiment tracking](https://github.com/elliottd/ku_gds_devops/tree/main/experiment_tracking)

You are supposed to complete 1-3 during the exercise session on February 6th and 4 during the exercise session on February 27th.

When doing the exercises, to maximize your DevOps experience you 
should prioritize:

1. Make yourself familiar with running commands in the terminal. The terminal can be a scary place, but it is an
   essential skill to be able to run commands without relying on a graphical interface. If you want a good introduction 
   to using the shell, I highly recommend the first two lectures from [this MIT course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

2. Only use scripts e.g. no notebooks for these exercises. Notebooks have their benefits but the fact is that developing
   software in the *real world* is done in scripts. Therefore make sure that whenever you are writing code for the
   exercises do this in `.py` scripts. If you feel like you miss the interactiveness of notebooks when working with the 
   script I can highly recommend giving [ipython](https://ipython.org/) a spin.

3. Get a good code editor, and try using it. If you do not have one, I can highly recommend
   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that are a lightweight editor, but through extensions can become 
   powerful. Otherwise, I also recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

Why should a data scientist care about DevOps? Because DevOps provides processes and tools for creating *reproducible*
experiments at scale when working with any kind of computer science/data science. Being able to ensure that your 
experiments are reproducible is important in the context of the scientific method:

</p>

Without reproducibility, the method breaks at the experimental stage, as non-reproducible experiments will most likely
lead to different results and thereby different conclusions on the initial hypothesis.

which goes over the nearly complete pipeline of designing, modeling and deploying machine learning applications.
